# Learn to Relax with Large Language Models: Solving Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems via Bidirectional Coevolution
We introduce AutoCO (\textbf{Auto}mated \textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization via LLM-driven bidirectional coevolution), the first end-to-end method that transforms LLMs from passive validators into proactive strategy designers for NCOPs.
